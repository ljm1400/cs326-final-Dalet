Innovative Idea:
Our idea is to create an application for users to share outdoor activity locations they find for rock climbing or hiking. The application will allow users to create posts that include pictures of the climbing spot or notable spots on the hike, information about the climbs or hiking routes, and give a rating for what hey have found (0-5 stars). Users can share these posts with other users, as well as comment on the posts of other users. Users will be able to filter posts based on if they are looking for hiking paths or outdoor climbing locations. 

This idea seems like it is related most to a Facebook-type/Instagram app in core functionally (creating and sharing posts with a comibination of images and text) however it is focused on a specific demographic of people looking for outdoor activities in the areas of rock-climbing and hiking. These are generally already fairly active communities in sharing spots that they find, but hopefully this would be able to become a hub for climbing and hiking enthusiasts to share their finds with others. Our hope is that we can also split these sections out based on type of post for ease of use for users, as there is some information that could be helpful when posting or searching for climbing routes that may not be applicable for hikes, and vice-versa. We could use tags as a way for people searching for a spot find what the type of activity we're looking for, or we could have different tabs to post different types of activities.

Important Components:
The important components of the application include functionality for users to register, login, and logout so that their posts and shares can be attached to a specific user. Users will also be able to create new posts that include images, a text description, and an optional rating for location that they found. If the activity is a hike or walking trail, the length of the trail could also be included, or an amount of time to climb. Users will be able to share existing posts with other users. Users will also be able to comment on other posts and leave a rating for their opinion of the spot that is included in the post. Each post will then also show the average rating between 0-5 stars. Users should also be able to filter posts based on a few categories, such as the type of activity (climbing or hiking), the average rating, and the location. We could also potentially have a place to include your location to show you only places close to you.
