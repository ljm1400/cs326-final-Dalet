Collection 1: Users

users {
  _id: ObjectId(),            //A unique object id assigned by mongo
  username: string,           //JSmith2454
  name: string,               //John Smith
  salt: string,               //the salt used to hash the user's password
  hash: string,               //the hash of the user's password concatenated with the salt
  pfpLink: IMG Link (string), //Public Profile Pic
  posts: array post ObjectId  //Holds the id's of the posts that this user created
  email: string              //JSmith@notreal.com
}

The database for Users has all of the information needed to identify a unique user. Each user has a unique ID #, username, and email. The pfpLink is the image file for the public profile. Each time a new user is added to the database, their ID increases by 1. We use password to authenticate users, and we keep their password in a separate file.

Functions of DB 1:
-Used to authenticate login information
-Going to "My Posts" shows all posts in our DB 2 where posts.author === users.username

Collection 2: Posts

posts {
  _id ObjectId(),       //Unique object id assigned by mongo
  ID: number        //Incremented every time a new post is made, used for postID's for html objects
  author: string        //username of the user that created the post
  title: string         //Title of the post given by the user
  type: string          //Selected value of Hiking or Climbing
  description: string   //User given description of the post
  images: Array []      //Contains created links (strings) of all the images submitted for the post
  tags: string          //Comma separated list of tags for the post, ex: Hiking, climbing, easy, difficult, etc.
  ratings: Array []     //Rating objects are in the form {author (username of the author), rating (number of the rating)}
  comments: Array []    //comment objects are in the form author (username of the author), commentBody (The string body of the comment)}
}

Within the DB for posts, there are two arrays, containing all of the different rating and comments that may be left on a post. Each post has a unique ID to help find the post later. Besides the rating and comment boxes, the rest of the information that gets stored in this DB comes directly from the "Create New Post" button on our site. When a new post is uploaded to the DB, the ratings and comment boxes are initialized as empty arrays.

Functions of DB 2:
-Adding ratings/comments: pushes new info into proper Array
-Only posts with type "Hiking" will be shown in the hiking section, and vice-versa with Climbing
-Searching for specific tags grabs all posts in the DB that match that tag
-Author of post will see post listed on myPosts page
