Our wireframes:

![homePage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/homePage.jpg)
This is our home page. We have tabs in the top of the page for pages specifically about climbing and hiking, as well as a tab to view My Posts. The climbing and hiking tabs look the same as this one, but with filters to only show whichever activity someone may look for. Each post has a section to post and view comments, as well as ratings for the trail. There is also a place to post a description of the trail, and a picture of the trail or a nice view from it. On the right hand side, there is a button that allows you to create your own post.

![loginPage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/loginPage.jpg)
The login page looks similar to many login pages for any social media type website. In the background of the login box, there will be a background image related to hiking/climbing. There's an option in the box to save your info so you don't have to log back in next time you visit the page.

![myPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/myPost.jpg)
This page displays a card view of any post you make yourself. To see more info about who commented on the post, you can click on the post and it will bring you to whichever tab is appropriate to show your post. The full description of these trails won't always fit on the card, so this page is more meant as a place to organize all of your posts in one place, instead of a place to view each post in full size.

![newPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/newPost.jpg)
If someone is on the home page, or the climbing or hiking pages, and wants to create their own post, there is a button on the right side of the page that will bring up this message prompt. Here is where the name of the trail and a description can be input, as well as the type of trail. There's also a place to include different tags, to help people find other similar trails.

![signup](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/signupPage.jpg)
The signup page looks similar to many sign up pages on many websites. There will be a place to input an email address and password, as well as a place to confirm your password. If the password box and the confirm password box match, you will successfully be able to create an account. In the background of the signup box will be a picture related to hiking/outdoors


Our HTML pages:

![homePage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/HomePage.PNG)
Homepage shows both hiking and climbing posts. Image takes up the center of the screen with a text box showing the user and the text contents of the post. Can scroll left or right to view the next or previous post. The climbing and hiking pages on the site are the same as this homepage but filtered to only show either hiking or climbing posts.

![loginPage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/login.PNG)
Simple login page which has users input their email and password to log into the site. 

![myPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/myPosts.PNG)
MyPost page shows a grid of a users personal posts. Can click on the button to take the user to the post where they will be able to see comments.

![newPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/CreatePostModal.PNG)
New Post modal pops up when a user clickes the create post button and has them input a title, any images, the type of post, a description, and any tags they want to add. Post will then be added to either the hiking or climbing pages.

![signup](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/signup.PNG)
Similar to the login page except this page has users confirm the password and it will create a new account.

![comment](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/PostComment.PNG)
Clicking the comment button opens up the comment input box where a user can type out their comment on a post.

![rate](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/RatePost.PNG)
Rate feature allows users to rate posts. We use a slider to have users choose 0-100 based on how much they liked the post.

![viewComments](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/HTMLscreens/ViewComments.PNG)
Niew comments screen shot shows how users will be able to see comments made on a post. Each comment will have the users name, picure and their comment.
