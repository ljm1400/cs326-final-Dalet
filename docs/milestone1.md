Our wireframes:

![homePage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/homePage.jpg)
This is our home page. We have tabs in the top of the page for pages specifically about climbing and hiking, as well as a tab to view My Posts. The climbing and hiking tabs look the same as this one, but with filters to only show whichever activity someone may look for. Each post has a section to post and view comments, as well as ratings for the trail. There is also a place to post a description of the trail, and a picture of the trail or a nice view from it. On the right hand side, there is a button that allows you to create your own post.

![loginPage](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/loginPage.jpg)
The login page looks similar to many login pages for any social media type website. In the background of the login box, there will be a background image related to hiking/climbing. There's an option in the box to save your info so you don't have to log back in next time you visit the page.

![myPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/myPost.jpg)
This page displays a card view of any post you make yourself. To see more info about who commented on the post, you can click on the post and it will bring you to whichever tab is appropriate to show your post. The full description of these trails won't always fit on the card, so this page is more meant as a place to organize all of your posts in one place, instead of a place to view each post in full size.

![newPost](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/newPost.jpg)
If someone is on the home page, or the climbing or hiking pages, and wants to create their own post, there is a button on the right side of the page that will bring up this message prompt. Here is where the name of the trail and a description can be input, as well as the type of trail. There's also a place to include different tags, to help people find other similar trails.

![signup](https://github.com/ljm1400/cs326-final-Dalet/blob/master/docs/wireframe/signupPage.jpg)
The signup page looks similar to many sign up pages on many websites. There will be a place to input an email address and password, as well as a place to confirm your password. If the password box and the confirm password box match, you will successfully be able to create an account. In the background of the signup box will be a picture related to hiking/outdoors
